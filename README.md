Being a fan of stand-up comedy for a long time, I was really disappointed when the pandemic started and the lack of live shows available. It was clear everyone from comedians to fans hated the only alternative, video live-streamed stand-up show.

That is where JokingOn comes into not only supplement comedian's live shows but to fully integrate into the comedy ecosystem. The goal of the project is to replace the hobbled together ecosystem of technologies that stand-up comedians use to send and receive notifications, interact with fans, event ticketing, audience growth, produce shows, and even writing jokes.

The platform operates on an NFT primitive basis meaning that every piece of content on the platform is based and deeply intergrated with an NFT. Our platform is a genuine example of what is possible with NFTs beyond simple art and novelties.

The platform is powered by its Laugh token which is automatically contributed via the application when the user laughs based on how hard they laugh. The token can also be used to buy both physical and digital merchandise (these may include NFTs of jokes or phrases of comedians), tickets, and subscribe to comedians for special perks when interacting with them.
